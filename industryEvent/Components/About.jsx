                <p>On September 7, 2023 i attended the New York Tech Social at BrainStation in Soho, Manhattan .
                    I met alot of  Pursuit fellows in person and even got to meet a few new people that attended BrainStation being in that
                    type of enviroment was new for me but i am glad i went into the space with an open mind . The BrainStation program is
                    similar to pursuit so that was nice to see there are other welcoming communites for tech beginners . Next event i go to i intend on putting myself out there more and being more prepared to asked valuable questions. No matter where you do or how you
                    do it contributing to future of tech will help solve the world problems one by one . My goal is to spread awareness and resource to other
                    people of color to help them join the mission .
